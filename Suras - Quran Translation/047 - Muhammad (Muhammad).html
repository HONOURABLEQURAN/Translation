47:1</a> Those who disbelieve and repel from the path of GOD, He nullifies their works.

<br>
<span id="2"class="ayet"><span name="47"class="sure"><span style="font-size:22px;">&#160;</span><br><a href="/p/47.html?m=1#2">

47:2</a> Those who believe and work righteousness, and believe in what was sent down to Muhammad - which is the truth from their Lord - He remits their sins, and blesses them with contentment.

</span></span>
<br>
<span id="3"class="ayet"><span name="47"class="sure"><span style="font-size:22px;">&#160;</span><br><a href="/p/47.html?m=1#3">

47:3</a> This is because those who disbelieve are following falsehood, while those who believe are following the truth from their Lord. GOD thus cites for the people their examples.

</span></span>
<br>
<span id="4"class="ayet"><span name="47"class="sure"><span style="font-size:22px;">&#160;</span><br><a href="/p/47.html?m=1#4">

47:4</a> If you encounter (in war) those who disbelieve, you may strike the necks. If you take them as captives you may set them free or ransom them, until the war ends. Had GOD willed, He could have granted you victory, without war. But He thus tests you by one another. As for those who get killed in the cause of GOD, He will never put their sacrifice to waste.

47:9</a> That is because they hated what GOD revealed and consequently, He nullifies their works.

<br>
<span id="10"class="ayet"><span name="47"class="sure"><span style="font-size:22px;">&#160;</span><br><a href="/p/47.html?m=1#10">

47:10</a> Did they not roam the earth and see the consequences for those before them? GOD destroyed their works; all disbelievers will suffer the same fate.

47:11</a> This is because GOD is the Lord of those who believe, while the disbelievers have no lord.

<br>
<span id="12"class="ayet"><span name="47"class="sure"><span style="font-size:22px;">&#160;</span><br><a href="/p/47.html?m=1#12">

47:12</a> GOD admits those who believe and lead a righteous life into gardens with flowing streams. As for those who disbelieve, they live and eat like the animals eat, then end up in the hellfire.

</span></span>
<br>
<span id="13"class="ayet"><span name="47"class="sure"><span style="font-size:22px;">&#160;</span><br><a href="/p/47.html?m=1#13">

47:13</a> Many a community was much stronger than the community that evicted you from your town; when we annihilated them, no one could help them.

<span id="14"class="ayet"><span name="47"class="sure"><span style="font-size:22px;">&#160;</span><br><a href="/p/47.html?m=1#14">

47:14</a> Are those enlightened by their Lord the same as those whose evil works are adorned in their eyes, and they follow their own opinions?

<br>
<span id="15"class="ayet"><span name="47"class="sure"><span style="font-size:22px;">&#160;</span><br><a href="/p/47.html?m=1#15">

47:15</a> The allegory of Paradise that is promised for the righteous is this: it has rivers of unpolluted water, and rivers of fresh milk, and rivers of wine - delicious for the drinkers - and rivers of strained honey. They have all kinds of fruits therein, and forgiveness from their Lord. (Are they better) or those who abide forever in the hellfire, and drink hellish water that tears up their intestines?

<br>
<span id="16"class="ayet"><span name="47"class="sure"><span style="font-size:22px;">&#160;</span><br><a href="/p/47.html?m=1#16">

47:16</a> Some of them listen to you, then as soon as they leave they ask those who were enlightened, "What did he just say?" GOD thus seals their hearts and, consequently, they follow only their opinions.

47:18</a> Are they waiting until the Hour comes to them suddenly? All the signs thereof have already come. Once the Hour comes to them, how will they benefit from their message?

47:19</a> You shall know that: "There is no other god beside GOD," and ask forgiveness of your sins and the sins of all believing men and women. GOD is fully aware of your decisions and your ultimate destiny.

<br>
<span id="20"class="ayet"><span name="47"class="sure"><span style="font-size:22px;">&#160;</span><br><a href="/p/47.html?m=1#20">

47:20</a> Those who believed said: "When will a new sura be revealed?" But when a straightforward sura was revealed, wherein fighting was mentioned, you would see those who harbored doubts in their hearts looking at you, as if death had already come to them. They were thus exposed.

47:26</a> This is because they said to those who hated what GOD has sent down, "We will obey you in certain matters." GOD fully knows their secret conspiracies.

47:28</a> This is because they followed what angered GOD and hated the things that please Him. Consequently, He has nullified their works.

47:30</a> If we will, we can expose them for you, so that you can recognize them just by looking at them. However, you can recognize them by the way they talk. GOD is fully aware of all your works.
